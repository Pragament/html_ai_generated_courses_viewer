      "content": "## Perfect Cubes\nA number that can be expressed as product of three equal integers.\n- 1 = 1×1×1, 8 = 2×2×2, 27 = 3×3×3, 64 = 4×4×4\n- Cube of even number is even\n- Cube of odd number is odd\n\n## Properties of Cube Numbers\n1. **Ending Digits:**\n   - Cube of number ending with 0 ends with 000\n   - Cube of number ending with 1 ends with 1\n   - Cube of number ending with 4 ends with 4\n   - Cube of number ending with 5 ends with 5\n   - Cube of number ending with 6 ends with 6\n   - Cube of number ending with 9 ends with 9\n\n2. **Relationship with Digital Root:**\n   - Digital root of perfect cube is 1, 8, or 9\n   - Digital root = Sum of digits until single digit\n\n3. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - In prime factorization of perfect cube, each prime appears 3 times or multiple of 3\n   - Example: 216 = 2³ × 3³\n\n## Finding Cube Root\n**Methods:**\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - Express as product of prime factors\n   - Group factors in triplets\n   - Take one from each triplet\n   - Example: ∛216 = ∛(2×2×2×3×3×3) = 2×3 = 6\n\n2. **Estimation Method:**\n   - Know cubes of numbers 1-10:\n     - 1³=1, 2³=8, 3³=27, 4³=64, 5³=125\n     - 6³=216, 7³=343, 8³=512, 9³=729, 10³=1000\n   - Example: ∛17576\n     - 17576 is between 15625(25³) and 19683(27³)\n     - Try 26: 26³ = 17576 ✓\n\n3. **Pattern Method for 2-digit numbers:**\n   - Look at last digit of cube\n   - Find cube root's last digit using pattern\n   - For 17576: Last digit 6 → cube root's last digit is 6\n   - Ignore last 3 digits (576), consider 17\n   - 2³=8, 3³=27, 17 is between 8 and 27 → tens digit is 2\n   - ∴ ∛17576 = 26\n\n## Hardy-Ramanujan Numbers\nNumbers that can be expressed as sum of two cubes in two different ways\n- 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ (Taxicab number)\n- 4104 = 2³ + 16³ = 9³ + 15³",

Magic Squares:**\nSum of numbers in each row, column, diagonal is same\n```\nExample (3×3):\n8 1 6\n3 5 7\n4 9 2\nSum = 15\n```\n\n**2. Number Puzzles:**\n- Find missing digits in operations\n- Cryptarithms: Letters represent digits\n\n**3. Tests of Divisibility:**\nProve general results:\n- A number divisible by both 2 and 3 is divisible by 6\n- If sum of digits divisible by 9, number divisible by 9\n\n## Applications\n1. **Checking calculations** using divisibility rules\n2. **Finding missing digits** in multiplication/division\n3. **Creating number puzzles** and solving them\n4. **Understanding place value** through general form",
