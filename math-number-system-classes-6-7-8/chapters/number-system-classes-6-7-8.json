      "content": "## Divisibility Rules: The Number Tests! 🧪\n\n**Simple Explanation:** Divisibility rules are quick magic tricks to test if numbers can be divided evenly!\n\n**Memory Aid:** Create a \"Divisibility Dance\" for each rule! 💃\n\n**The Rule Parade:**\n\n**Divisible by 2:** \"Ends with even digit, that's the trick! 0,2,4,6,8 do the click!\" 👯\n\n**Divisible by 3:** \"Add all digits, sum you'll see, divisible by 3? Then so is he!\" ➕\n\n**Divisible by 4:** \"Last two digits, take a look, divisible by 4? Check the book!\" 📖\n\n**Divisible by 5:** \"Ends with 0 or 5, that's alive! Easy check, helps us thrive!\" 5️⃣\n\n**Divisible by 6:** \"Passes 2 and 3's test, then 6 is impressed, it's the best!\" 🤹\n\n**Divisible by 9:** \"Like rule for 3, but sum by 9, so fine!\" 9️⃣\n\n**Divisible by 11:** \"Odd place sum, even place sum, difference zero or 11's chum!\" 🔢\n\n**Interactive Activity:** \"Divisibility Speed Challenge\"\nTest 672 quickly:\n- 2? Last digit 2 ✓\n- 3? 6+7+2=15 ÷3=5 ✓\n- 4? 72÷4=18 ✓\n- 6? Passes 2 & 3 ✓\n- 8? 672÷8=84 ✓\n- 9? 15 not ÷9 ✗\n- 11? (6+2)-7=1 ✗\n\n## Numbers in Costume: General Form! 🎭\n\n**Two-digit number:** ab = 10a + b\nExample: 37 = 10×3 + 7 = 30 + 7\n\n**Three-digit number:** abc = 100a + 10b + c\nExample: 459 = 400 + 50 + 9\n\n**The Reversal Magic:**\nTake any 2-digit number: 37\nReverse: 73\nSum: 37+73 = 110 = 11×10 ✓ Divisible by 11!\nDifference: 73-37 = 36 = 9×4 ✓ Divisible by 9!\n\n**Proof:** ab = 10a+b, ba = 10b+a\nSum = 11a+11b = 11(a+b)\nDifference = 9a-9b = 9(a-b)\nMAGIC! ✨\n\n## Magic Squares: The Number Balance! ⚖️\n\n**Simple Explanation:** Magic squares are grids where every row, column, diagonal adds to SAME magic sum!\n\n**The 3×3 Classic:**\n```\n8 1 6\n3 5 7\n4 9 2\nMagic Sum = 15\nCheck: 8+1+6=15, 3+5+7=15, 4+9+2=15\n      8+5+2=15, 6+5+4=15\nALL 15! MAGIC! 🔮\n```\n\n**Creating Magic:** For 3×3 using 1-9:\n1. Middle number = 5\n2. Even numbers at corners\n3. Opposites sum to 10\n\n## Cryptarithms: Letter Number Puzzles! 🔤\n\n**Simple Explanation:** Letters represent digits. Same letter = same digit. Different letters = different digits.\n\n**Example:**\n  AB\n×  A\n----\n CAB\n\nSolve: A=1, B=2, C=1? Wait, C different from A... Puzzle time! 🧩\n\n**Think About It:** 🤔\nWhy do divisibility rules work? \nCan you prove 3's rule? \nWhy does reversing digits give 11 and 9 multiples?\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n- Quick mental calculations 🧠\n- Error checking in numbers ✓\n- Creating puzzles and games 🎲\n- Coding and encryption 🔐",
